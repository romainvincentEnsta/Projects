The Python files were used to process data from my internship at SINTEF Ocean. There I worked on bubble-drag reduction in order to reduce skin-friction for ships. The report I produced which is 40 pages is confidential for now.
The pdf file is the lab report we produced during my time at NTNU, I did the theory and the TKE decay exponent part. 
I now work on the BESSI project which is in collaboration between CNRS in France and the Bergen university in Norway. https://git.app.uib.no/melt-team-bergen/bessi
